<h2> Example </h2>
This directory includes an example of what the input should look like and what results the output will give.
Do the command: python3 canalyzer.py -f Example/Input/testfile.txt -p F00A
This should generate a folder called "Canalyzer-Outputs" with all 6 of the output files. Some files may be empty, but that's because the PGN could have not recieved any messages and.or didn't send any messages.
